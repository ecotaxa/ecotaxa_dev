	<!-- For explore -->
	<div class="col-sm-6">
		<p>As a visitor, you have free access to the specimens that have been already identified by taxonomist experts.</p>
		
		<p>You can explore the database by navigating along the UniEuk taxonomic tree which aims at unifying taxonomic names and tree according to reliable and curated molecular phylogenies. It encompasses the whole Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic lineages (Viruses coming soon) that have been molecularly described. Then images can be filtered according to several sample criteria: geographic location, depth, date and time of sampling, and imaging instrument.</p>

	<!-- For projects -->
	<div class="col-sm-6">
		<p>As a scientist, you can contribute to the richness of this image database and/or to the collaborative taxonomic annotation effort. Images are organised in projects which should be consistent in terms of sampling and imaging techniques. We provide tools to support the annotation of large image datasets by supervised machine learning prediction.
